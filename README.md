# Functions-
These blocks of code are about functions. 
The second and third blocks of codes specifically are two different method of finding the volume of a cylinder using a defined variable.
Personally, I prefer the third block of code. It is simplicity at it's best and I believe simple codes are the key to excellent coding.
Although, with the second code, you can alter it at many places.
